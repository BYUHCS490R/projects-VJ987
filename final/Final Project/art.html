    <h2>Clothing, Art, & Tattoos</h2>
    <p>Traditional Tahitian clothing, art, and tattoos (tatau) are full of meaning. Each pattern and design tells a story and reflects the values, history, and identity of the Tahitian people. The pāreu and dance costumes often use natural materials and symbolic patterns, connecting the wearer to both nature and their ancestors. Crafts like tapa cloth, weaving, and wood carving are passed down through generations, while tatau mark important milestones, family heritage, or personal achievements. All of these forms of expression help keep Tahitian culture alive and strengthen the sense of community and pride among the people.</p>

        <p><strong>Tatau (Tattoo):</strong> Traditional Polynesian tattooing represents heritage, protection, and family lineage. As well as its social aspect, tattooing also had a sacred dimension, rooted in Polynesian culture. Tattoos were considered as a gift from the gods that bestowed a supernatural power on the wearer. Certain designs were specially conceived to protect the wearer and preserve his Mana.</p>
