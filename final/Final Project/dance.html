    <h2>Ori Tahiti</h2>
    <p>Traditional Tahitian dances are called Ori Tahiti. They are performed during celebrations and festivals. These dances tell stories and express the emotions of the people. The 'Ori Tahiti almost disappeared when missionaries arrived in Tahiti. The sensual, rhythmic dancing, accompanied by the powerful to'ere drums, was considered too provocative, so it was banned. Fortunately, not everyone followed the ban. Families kept the tradition alive, passing it down secretly from mother to daughter and father to son. Today, Tahitian dance has reclaimed its rightful place as a central part of Polynesian culture, still alive with the beat of the to'ere drums and the voices of the pupu himene choirs.</p>

    <p>Music is an essential part of these dances, with drums and other instruments creating rhythms that accompany the movements. Understanding dance and music helps us appreciate Tahitian culture and values.</p>
