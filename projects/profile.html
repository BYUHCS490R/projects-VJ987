    <h1>VAIANU MARITERAGI</h1>
    <P>Hello my name is <strong>Vaianu Mariteragi</strong>, I was born in Tahiti, a small yet beautiful island located in the Pacific Ocean. I grew up surrounded by my cousins, we would gather after school and make up games, how fun it was, until that sad day when we had to move from Tahiti to another island, Huahine. Without any cousins around, I didn't know how to spend my days, I was lost. But thankfully I still had my siblings or in other words, people I could annoy. </P>
    <p>This new chapter in my life eneded up being great, I met new people, made new friends and found new cousins. Now, after spending most of my life in Huahine, when I introduce myself <mark>I always say that I'm from Huahine</mark> even though I was born in Tahiti. Huahine is just better (HUAHINE &gt; TAHITI), you might ask why:</p>
