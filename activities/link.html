    <h3>1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h3>
    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/be-not-troubled?lang=eng">Elder Ronald A. Rasband</a>
    <h3>2. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h3>
    <p>The root is basically the starting point of a website. In a computer or website, it's like the main folder that holds everything. The path is like the address of a file or a folder. So, when you want to find something, the path tells you where it is and if you want to go to a specific file, the path shows you which folders to open.</p>
    <h3>3. What is a default document?</h3>
    <p>A default document is the webpage that shows up automatically when you go to a website or folder without specifying a file.</p>
    <h3>4. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
    <p>An absolute link is a full address, and is mainly used to link other website while a relative link is shorter and just gives the path from where you are right now and it is used when you're linking to pages within the same site because it's easier.</p>
    <h3>5. Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h3>
    <a href="https://byuhcs490r.github.io/projects-VJ987/activities/structural.html">Another Engagement</a>
    <h3>6. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They are based on where you are on the site right now.</li>
            <li>They don't show the full website address.</li>
            <li>They tell the browser where to go.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>7. Link to your last project.</h3>
    <a href="https://byuhcs490r.github.io/projects-VJ987/projects/profile2.html">Last Project</a>
    <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
